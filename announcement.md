It is with great pleasure that I can announce the transfer of Morphia to the MorphiaOrg organization on github.  As a long term developer and supporter of Morphia, I've been working with MongoDB for this move.  I know there have been questions of late about Morphia's future, so I hope this move to being community managed helps reassure everyone.   Morphia will now continue development out in the community and I'm thrilled to lead this effort.

There's quite the backlog of issues to deal with and some new stuff in the pipeline.  I have a lot of code ready to merge to use the latest POJO codec code in the Java driver which gives us better mapping support, e.g.

Over the course of the next while there's a lot to get done.  We'll need to migrate the packages to something outside of org.mongodb, e.g.  The documentation could use a facelift.  And, of course, we'll want to get releases rolling out again.  I do hope that you'll join me in moving Morphia forward even if it's just filing issues.
